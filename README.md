## Project_Description

The proposed plan is to create a website that offers a diverse range of games for users to enjoy, with the flexibility to choose games that suit their preferences. A mandatory sign-up and login process will allow access to the games and enable us to save users' game scores and maintain a leaderboard that showcases the top performers. Users will also have the option to m view their recently played games for reference. Overall, the website promises to be a one-stop platform for gamers seeking a variety of options to choose from.
